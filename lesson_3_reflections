When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You might want to share your work publicly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might add changes to the remote that you don't yet want to "finalize" by adding them locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A branch is creating a new path of commits off of an existing repository.
A clone is creating a local copy of a new reposity.
A fork is just a clone on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

So you have it on your machine where it is not likely to get lost. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub it would be hard to keep track of the different changes people made.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

Keeping things in the master reduces the chance that you make a mistake just due to 
coordination costs, but using branches allows you to change more and be more
exploratory with your coding.
